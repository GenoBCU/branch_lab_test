# branch_lab_test

  Our purpose here is to demonstrate team-based Git workflows. To do this the team must create branches of a main repository, build and test basic python code, push their branches and create pull requests and merge changes      upstream.
  The team reviews and tests each others code. This simulates a real-world industry scenario.
